# Synsplore
Learning to explore the synthesizable chemical space, conditioned on target pharmacophores.

## TODOs
### Data Generation
- [x] Reading data and creating a storage for mols, rxns, matching
- [ ] Preprocessing filters for dataset molecules
- [x] Featurizing mols, rxns
- [x] Sampling synthesis routes 
- [x] Filter for sampling routes (no duplicates)
- [x] Featurizing synthesis routes 
- [ ] Pharm generation for syn route products
- [ ] (?) Dimensionality reduction for molecules

### Dataset
- [ ] Main torch dataset (initiating, loading, saving, indexing)
- [ ] Storage to tensors transform
- [ ] Pharm feature location/value noise transform
- [ ] Pharm feature masking transform

## Installation
